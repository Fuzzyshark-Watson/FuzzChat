This part of the App is my desktop version, which uses Electron

Package.json contains the packages that belong to this wing of the project.

During startup in desktopmain.js, it runs the preload.js which is supposed to make the application more secure. As part of the electron application.

This is the lower priority version, so once the mobile version works, I will rework code to suit a desktop version.
